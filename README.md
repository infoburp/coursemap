coursemap
=========

A map of the Computing & Website Development HND/BSc (Hons) course at Bolton University.
The code is general enough that it should work for other courses at Bolton,
but you'll have to put a list of the modules of your course into the modules array
in get_course_json.py. Then, running python get_course_json.py should print your json.
Paste this over sampledata.json.

If I can somehow get hold of a list of modules by course for all of the courses
at Bolton, I could improve this a lot, but I cannot currently find such a list...
